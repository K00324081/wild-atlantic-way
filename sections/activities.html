        <h2 class="act_h2">Árainn - Inis Mór (Inishmore)</h2>
        <p>Located 8km off the coast of County Galway, Inishmore is an extension of the famous limestone rocks of The Burren and hosts a plethora of rare wild flowers, such as gentian violets and orchids. Walk or cycle the narrow lane ways to discover the island's most celebrated monument, Dún Aonghusa. One of the most famous prehistoric sites in Europe, this semi-circular stone fort sits dramatically on top of a cliff. Uncover the circular forts, early Christian remains, 12th Century high crosses and medieval churches that are scattered across the island.</p>
